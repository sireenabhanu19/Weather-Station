# Weather-Station
TheThis project is a system that uses wireless sensors to track temperature, humidity, and rainfall in real-time. It sends this data to a smartphone app so users can check live weather conditions from anywhere. This setup is useful for farms, research labs, food storage, and other places needing up-to-date weather information.
